Groupie Trackers consists on receiving a given API and manipulate the data contained in it, in order to create a site, displaying the information.

I have been given an API, that consists in four parts:

1. artists, containing information about some bands and artists like their name(s), image, in which year they began their activity, the date of their first album and the members.

2. locations, consists in their last and/or upcoming concert locations.

3. dates, consists in their last and/or upcoming concert dates.

4. relation, does the link between all the other parts, artists, dates and locations.
